# archers-journey
This project is about prototyping a 2D game with pure HTML5 &amp; JAVASCRIPT. The goal is not to use any frameworks or libraries.
It aims for mobile screens with touch control in mind.

## How to play
Just visit [the playground](https://archersjourney.w3spaces.com/) or clone the repository to your local harddrive with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ErikUckert/archers-journey.git
```

If you run on on your Computer you will need to emulate a mobile screen to actualy use the touch control. Most of the modern browser provide that feature, for example check [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/) for google chrome.
